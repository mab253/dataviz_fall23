**A note on code comments:**
Inside your functional code, if you have used code that comes from another programmer or another project, you need to cite this explicitly. You can write a comment directly above where this code starts, and cite the source by including the project name, the programmer's name (if known), and a link to where you found this code. Include the date that you found it, if possible.

For example: 

```
/***********
  This code was adapted from:
  David Bowie
  https://github.com/davidjonesbowie/the_exact_file_where_you_found_the_.code
  Accessed: Oct. 2022
*************/
```
*You do not need to follow this format exactly, but your comment should cite the same information (name, link/source, and date if possible)*

In written language for a paper, we also cite when it's not a direct quote, but it is an *idea* that we learned from a specific source. If you have parts of your project that fit this description, please comment and cite here as well. 

Example:

```
/* The following method is inspired by work done by Proton the Cat, Jupyter notebook available @ https://github.com/proton-the-cat */
```

**This commenting and citation of code is NOT OPTIONAL.** If you do not cite code where you have copied either the exact lines or the inspiring method of someone else, this could be considered plagiarism in the context of this final project.
