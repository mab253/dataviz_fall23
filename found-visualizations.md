# üìà weekly post: found visualization

Each week (starting in Week 2, Sept. 13), you will be tasked with finding 1 data visualization "in the wild," and sharing it on our [Discord server](https://github.com/mab253/dataviz_fall23/blob/main/discord.md) in the #found-visualizations channel.

For each post, you'll need to:
- add an image of the visualization (or a screenshot if it's interactive, multimedia, etc.)
- cite the source: give us the link where you found it (or book! etc.), and name the author if available
- write a short paragraph about how this visualization relates to the week's theme and readings.

The visualization you find can be one that you like, that exemplifies the principles we're discussing, that inspires you; or, it can be one that you want to critique, one that might be misleading or particularly difficult to read. It might be something in between. Tell us why this visualization strikes you! It can be in any format (chart, graph, map, table, interactive, sonification, hand-drawn, live performance, etc. etc.).

The goal of this assignment is for you to start seeing data and visualizations in the world around you, and for us to have a breadth of examples to discuss in-class. In the Discord channel, you will essentially be building a library of sources that you and your peers can use to learn from examples for your final projects and future projects. We will also sharpen our critical skills and get used to quickly sharing our work.

You will be assessed based on completion (did you find the visualization, post it on-time, cite the source, and give a short talk if it's your turn?), and thoughtfulness. These do not have to be complete essays, but your short paragraphs should clarify your thought process in choosing the example and should invite rich questions from your classmates.

### üó∫Ô∏è where to find visualizations?

There is a **[list here](https://github.com/mab253/dataviz_fall23/blob/main/sources-list.md)** that I've started (and will add to!) - but you are welcome to find other online sources, take a photo of 1 on a subway ad or from a book, hand-draw your own ...

## ‚ö°Ô∏è mini-talk

Each class session after Week 2, 2-3 students in each class session will give an informal, 2-3 (_5 minute absolute max._) presentation of the visualization they chose.
